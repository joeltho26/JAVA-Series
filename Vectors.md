# Vectors:
- Vector implements a dynamic array which means it can grow or shrink as required. 
- Like an array, it contains components that can be accessed using an integer index.
- it is rarely used in a non-thread environment as it is synchronized, and due to this, it gives a poor performance in adding, searching, deleting, and updating its elements.
- They are synchronized and thread safe when multithreading
    - whereas ArrayList is un-synchronized and not thread safe (means all threads will access the field members(variables/attributes) and methods in parallel)
